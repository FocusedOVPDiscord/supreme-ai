SUPREME AI BOT - COMMAND REGISTRATION FIX
==========================================

PROBLEM:
--------
Discord slash commands were not automatically registering when deployed to Koyeb.
Commands would take up to 1 hour to appear because only global sync was used.

FILES MODIFIED:
--------------
1. bot/main_direct.py
   - Added guild-specific command sync for instant registration
   - Commands now appear immediately when DISCORD_GUILD_ID is set
   - Maintains global sync as fallback
   - Enhanced logging and error handling

2. bot/commands_v2.py
   - Added /sync command for manual command re-sync
   - Admin-only command for troubleshooting
   - Better error messages

NEW FILES:
----------
3. COMMAND_REGISTRATION_FIX.md
   - Complete documentation of the fix
   - Deployment instructions for Koyeb
   - Troubleshooting guide

KEY CHANGES:
------------
✓ Guild-specific sync for instant command registration
✓ Fallback to global sync if guild sync fails
✓ Manual /sync command for troubleshooting
✓ Better logging to track command registration
✓ Lists all guilds bot is in on startup

REQUIRED ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE:
